# find-cheap-flight [finished]

Uses geonames and Google QPX Express to find trips that should be cheap when searched using "google flights" !
for a 1 adult round trip !

You can enter
- a range of departure dates
- a range of stay duration
- a number of start and end airports

This program is by no means perfect - it is not able to get the same price as using google flights directly - therefore it can only serve to find trends

to use it you need a google project and credentials for :
- OAuth 2.0 client ID >> Other
- API key >> Browser

additionally the following APIs need to be enabled :
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- QPX Express Airfare API

and a Geonames account
